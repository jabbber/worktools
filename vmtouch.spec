%changelog
* Fri Oct 16 2015 1.0.1
  * Change default max file size (specified with -m) to
    SIZE_MAX instead of 500m. This is 4G on 32-bit systems
    and effectively unlimited on 64-bit systems.
    (Thanks Erik Garrison)
  * -p mode which lets you view/touch/evict/lock ranges of
    files instead of just whole files. (Thanks Justas Lavi≈°ius)
  * Update debian packaging files. (Thanks Luka Blaskovic)
  * Fix bug that prevented you from trying to crawl your
    entire filesystem from the root.
  * Fix to work with glibc 2.20. (Thanks Jim Garrison)
  * Fix format string warning when compiling with clang.
    (Thanks Mikolaj Golub)
  * Cleaner and better Makefile. (Thanks Emmanuel Kasper and
    Mikolaj Golub)
  * Don't double-count the same file that just happens to have
    multiple hard-links to it. (Thanks Carsten Otto)
  * Add option to wait for daemon mode to finish mlocking.
    (Thanks Kristofer Karlsson)
* Mon Dec 4 2012 0.8.0
  * Patch from Marc Brooker: avoid overflowing stack when
    allocating array for mincore() output
  * Patch from Federico Lucifredi: Avoid ugly NaNs in output
  * Full OS X support: msync(2) evicts pages on this system
  * HP-UX support from Shane Seymour (thanks!)
  * Patch from soarpenguin: detect invalid size formats
